# ML-PROJECT

#We will predict the quality of wine on the basis of following features.

1.type

2.fixed acidity

3.volatile acidity

4.citric acid

5.residual sugar

6.chlorides

7.free sulfur dioxide

8.total sulfur dioxide

9.density

10.pH

11.sulphates

12.alcohol

13.quality

In predicted output 1 represents the quality greater than 0.7 which is  good quality wine and 0 represents the quality below 0.7 which is not a good quality wine.
